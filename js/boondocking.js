Veer left at the fork in CR-47 (Larimer County) and it takes you up to a parking area.  Jeep road heads north and south from parking area.  Head south, and pull off is on your right.  Site has little privacy from the jeep road / parking area.  Definitely not for RVs.  4wd recommended.  If you have a very good 4wd vehicle, you might be able to camp nearby further South (or North) off of the 4wd road.  You *might* be able to find another spot closer to the gravel.  Great for accessing Estes Park and Rocky Mountain National Park.  Off of CR 47 (Larimer County).",

Two of the trailheads(at the lookout tower and coy bald) have picnic tables and fire rings, one(Blair Ridge Road) is just a place to park(3 maybe 4 vehicles)but around it there is PLENTY of room to set up and camp.  I would NOT try to get an RV to coy bald, but the lookout tower trailhead is used by horse trailers and is a short gravel road off Hwy 125.

I would be surprised if this were still open/free due to overuse.  4wd recommended, very sandy and narrow road.\n\nUpdate: I stayed overnight at this free BLM campsite July 28, 2009 and loved it. Look for mile marker 24 on Utah SR9 about 8 miles from Springdale, UT (entrance to Zion National Park). It does get busier on some weekends but it was great. I swam in the Virgin River and drove my Prius (very slowly) through the sand to a spot 20 feet from the river to pitch my tent. There were some rocks that I had to dodge at the entrance to the campground, and I was very careful to drive in not to soft of sand. My only complaint was the millions of ants in the sand.",

Free camping along Pingree Park road is pretty much nil, as it's posted you must camp 1/4 mile from the \"highway.\" Lots of ranger activity, so camp conservatively to avoid tickets. Have traveled passed this campsite several times, and it's usually in use.\n\nSmall RV's would work, but not suitable for longer monsters. Very comfortable for a VW Westfalia, you could probably fit 3. Doesn't need to be 4wd as the access roads are well maintained.",

Follow CR 3440 along the West side of the lake for several miles until you reach a public boat ramp next to a small Italian Restuarant.  To the right just before the restuarant turn into Fish Hawk Point.  This park has no sign but does have two signs, one stating \"tents only\" and the other indicating a public restroom.  The road follows the ridge of a penninsula.  It is a little steep but many tent locations are available.\n\nThe bathroom (men's and women's) have flush toilets nut no sinks.  The men's bathroom has a faucet on the supply to the toilet.  This is an unsupervised coounty park.  The bathrooms were dated but clean because the county has someone come out once or twice a week to pick up trash and keep the bathrooms presentable. The lake has really clean water and a couple of areas to swim with sandy bottoms.  \n\nThe road ends in a circle and the park gets a lot of traffic all night long.  Probably beer drinking and whoopie.\n\nThis would be a good stop if you were traveling between Dallas and Shreveport.  It is not far off of US 80 (the old highway between Dallas and Shreveport before Interstate Highways) and can be reached in Terrel and Longview.  If you are in a hurry don't bother.",

There is a maximum stay of 14 days.\n\nThe entire area is very scenic, and NM 475 is also designated as the Santa Fe Scenic Byway. Because of the large stands of aspen trees, the area is very busy, especially in the fall aspen viewing season. There are additional recreation opportunities along NM 475, both above and below Big Tesuque Campground, including hiking and biking trails, picnic areas, and in the winter both nordic and alpine skiing and snow shoeing. Tesuque is pronounced \"Teh-soo-key\".\n\nhttp://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/santafe/recarea/?recid=75602",
